# CyberMelz Security+ (SY0-701) Study Notes

Welcome to my public Security+ (SY0-701) learning vault.  
This GitHub repository contains organized, high-quality study notes for each domain of the exam, plus my own reflections and SOC analyst preparation tools.

These notes are curated from my private Notion workspace, rewritten and polished to serve as proof of work for my cybersecurity journey — especially as I prepare for real-world SOC analyst roles.

## Why This Exists

After years in healthcare and pharmacy, I chose to pivot into cybersecurity to protect people in a new way — through data, systems, and awareness.  
I am currently preparing for the **CompTIA Security+ SY0-701** certification and learning hands-on via platforms like **TryHackMe**, **Splunk**, and Sigma rules.

I believe cybersecurity isn't just about tools — it's about protecting what matters.
